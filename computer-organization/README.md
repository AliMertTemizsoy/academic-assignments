# Computer Organization

This directory contains projects and assignments related to Computer Organization and Architecture courses. These projects focus on hardware design, CPU architecture, and low-level computing concepts.

## Projects

### [ALU Design](./alu-design)
An implementation of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), one of the crucial components of a CPU.

**Key Concepts:**
- Digital logic design
- Boolean algebra and logic operations
- Binary arithmetic operations
- Hardware description using Verilog/VHDL

**Description:**
This project involves designing and implementing an ALU capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.). The implementation demonstrates understanding of combinational logic circuits and binary operations fundamental to computer architecture.

### [Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor](./single-cycle-riscv-processor)
A simple implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor.

**Key Concepts:**
- CPU architecture and design
- Instruction set architecture (ISA)
- Datapath and control unit design
- Performance analysis

**Description:**
This project implements a basic single-cycle RISC-V processor that can execute a subset of the RISC-V instruction set. It includes components such as the register file, ALU, control unit, and memory interfaces. The implementation demonstrates understanding of how instructions flow through a CPU and how different components work together to execute programs.
