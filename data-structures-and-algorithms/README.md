# Data Structures and Algorithms

This directory contains projects and assignments related to Data Structures and Algorithms courses. These projects focus on implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms for efficient problem-solving.

## Projects

### [Divide and Conquer](./divide-and-conquer)
Implementation of algorithms that use the divide and conquer strategy.

**Key Concepts:**

Problem decomposition
Recursive problem solving
Merge sort and quicksort
Binary search
Complexity analysis

**Description:**
This project explores divide and conquer algorithms that break complex problems into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their solutions. The implementation demonstrates how this approach can lead to efficient solutions for sorting, searching, and other computational tasks.

### [Music Program Using Linked Lists](./linked-list-music-program)
A music playlist manager using linked list data structure.

**Key Concepts:**

Linked list operations
Dynamic memory allocation
Pointer manipulation
Data structure design
Music playlist management

**Description:**
This project implements a music playlist application using linked lists. It allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal of music tracks, demonstrating the practical application of linked list data structures in organizing sequential data with dynamic operations.
Trees with Business Structure

### [Business Structure using Trees](./trees-with-business-structure)

**Key Concepts:**

Tree data structures
Hierarchical data representation
Tree traversal algorithms
Parent-child relationships
Organizational structure modeling

**Description:**
This project uses tree data structures to model business hierarchies, demonstrating how trees can effectively represent organizational relationships. The implementation includes operations for adding departments/employees, traversing the organization, and performing hierarchical queries.
