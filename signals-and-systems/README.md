## Overview
This repository contains assignments and projects from the Signals and Systems course. It focuses on signal processing concepts, system analysis, and related mathematical tools that are fundamental to understanding how signals interact with systems.

## Projects

### [Discrete-Time Convolution](./discrete-time-convolution)
An implementation of discrete-time convolution, a fundamental operation in digital signal processing that describes how the input of a system is related to its output.

**Key Concepts:**
- Linear time-invariant (LTI) systems
- Impulse response
- Discrete-time convolution sum
- Signal representation and manipulation

**Description:**
This project implements the discrete-time convolution algorithm, which is essential for understanding how signals are processed in digital systems. The implementation demonstrates the mathematical operation of convolution between two discrete-time signals and visualizes the results to show how the output signal is formed.
