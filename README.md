# Academic Assignments

Welcome to my academic assignments repository! This collection showcases various projects and assignments completed during my Computer Engineering education at Yıldız Technical University.

## Course Collections

This repository is organized by courses, each in its own directory:

- [Computer Organization](./computer-organization): Projects focusing on computer architecture, assembly programming, verilog and hardware design
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](./data-structures-and-algorithms): Implementations of various data structures and algorithms with analysis
- [Signals and Systems](./signals-and-systems): Assignments related to signal processing, system analysis, and transformations

## About These Assignments

These assignments represent my academic journey and demonstrate my understanding of core computer engineering concepts. Each project includes documentation explaining the problem, approach, and implementation details.

The code in this repository showcases my:
- Problem-solving skills
- Implementation capabilities in different programming languages
- Understanding of theoretical computer science concepts
- Application of engineering principles to real-world problems

## Skills Demonstrated

Throughout these assignments, I've worked with:
